_Pig Latin Specifications

The program should add "ay" to words that begin with a vowel.
  Example Input: animal
  Example Output: animalay
For words that begin with a single consonant, the program should move the first consonant to the end of the word, then add "ay".
  Example Input: cat
  Example Output: atcay
The program should treat 'y' as a consonant, moving the y to the end of the word and then adding an "ay".
  Example: yes
  Example Output: esyay
For words that begin with two consonants, the program should move both consonants to the end and add "ay".
  Example Input: step
  Example Output: epstay
For words that begin with three consonants, the program should move all three consonants to the end and add "ay".  
  Example Input: street
  Example Output: eetstray
For would that start with qu, move both the "q" and the "u" to the end and add "ay"
    Example Input: quit
    Example Output: itquay
The program should perform function for multiple words.
  Example Input: pig latin
  Example Output: igpay atinlay
The program should validate the characters are alphabetic.
  Example Input: 3 pigs
  Example Output: false / error
The program should keep capitalization in place for one word.
    Example Input: Hello
